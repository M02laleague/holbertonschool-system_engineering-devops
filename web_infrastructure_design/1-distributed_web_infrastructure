# Distributed Web Infrastructure

## Diagram


## Components
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic using round-robin algorithm.
- **Web Servers**: Serve static files and forward requests to the application servers.
- **Application Servers**: Process application logic.
- **Primary-Replica Database**: Improves read performance and redundancy.

## Issues
- SPOF: Load balancer and primary database.
- Security: No HTTPS or firewalls.
- No monitoring implemented.

## Improvements
- Add redundancy to the load balancer (cluster).
- Implement HTTPS and firewalls.
- Use monitoring tools for performance metrics.
