## Components
### Load Balancers (HAProxy)
- **Role**: Distributes traffic between web servers.
- **Cluster**: Active-Active setup to share the load.

### Web Servers (Nginx)
- Serve static content and forward requests to application servers.

### Application Servers
- Handle application logic independently.

### Database Cluster
- **Primary Database**: Handles writes and synchronizes with replicas.
- **Replica Database**: Handles reads to reduce the load on the primary.

## Issues
1. Increased complexity due to additional components.
2. Single Points of Failure (SPOF) still exist in some layers.

## Improvements
1. Add redundancy for web and application servers.
2. Use advanced monitoring tools for real-time performance tracking.
