# Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure

## Diagram


## Components
### Security
- **Firewalls**:
  - Protect the network, application, and database layers.
- **SSL/TLS Certificate**:
  - Secures communications via HTTPS.

### Monitoring
- **Monitoring Clients**:
  - Collect data like CPU, memory usage, and queries per second.

### Base Structure
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic using round-robin algorithm.
- **Web Servers**: Serve static files.
- **Application Servers**: Handle business logic.
- **Primary-Replica Database**: Improves read performance and redundancy.

## Issues
1. SSL termination at the Load Balancer can be a vulnerability.
2. Single primary database is a SPOF for write operations.
3. Servers with identical components may reduce efficiency.

## Improvements
- Add redundancy to the primary database.
- Use end-to-end SSL encryption.
- Implement more advanced monitoring tools.
